Simple GUI that allows for the resizing of various image formats, and adding and removing colors from images
Intially built to edit thumbnails for a [calculator project](https://github.com/Pectacius/Calculus-Matrix-Calculator)

## Description
A tkinter GUI that uses pillow to:
- resize images based on input length and width ratios
- replace specific pixel colors with another color

#### Supported Image Formats

Currently, the file search function filters, and the file save options are:
 - `.bmp`
 - `.jpg / .jpeg`
 - `.png`
 - `.svg`
 - `.tiff`
 
 Pillow can support more formats, so feel free to add more file formats to the `valid_file_types` tuple in `main.py`:
 
 ```
valid_file_types = (("Bitmap files", "*.bmp*"),
                        ("JPEG files", "*.jpg*"),
                        ("PNG files", "*.png*"),
                        ("SVG files", "*.svg*"),
                        ("TIFF files", "*.tiff*"))
```

## Setup
1. Clone repository and run `pdm sync` to install dependencies in new environment
2. run `main.py` via `pdm run python ./src/main.py`

## Usage
#### General
![Application](info/toolbar.PNG)

- `Browse Files` allows an image file to be selected
- `View Loaded` opens the selected image in default image viewer
- Preview the resized image in default image viewer with `View Edited`
- `Reload` removes all changes to edited image. Equivalent to using `Browse Files` again, removes the need to select the file again ;)
- Save the edited image with `Save`

#### Resize Tool
![File](info/resize.PNG)

- Type x and y resize ratios in the boxes for `X Ratio` and `Y Ratio` respectively (i.e. to halve the size of the width type `0.5` in `X Ratio`)
- Press `Resize` to apply the ratios to the loaded image
- `Loaded X Size`, `Loaded Y Size`, `Resized X Size` and `Resized Y Size` displays the pixels of the loaded and edited image respectively (Helps you make judgements on picking resize ratios)
- `Clear` is a little macro to remove all inputs in the resize ratio boxes

#### Replace Color Tool
![File](info/color_replace.PNG)

- `Replace Modes` shows the available color replacement modes
  - `Match Exact` replaces only the specified RGBA color in the `Color To Replace` box with the specified RGBA color in the `Color To Replace With` box
  - `Match Not` replaces all colors but the specified RGBA color in the `Color to Replace` box with the specified RGBA color in the `Color to Replace With` box
- Similarly the `Clear` is a little macro to remove all color values in the color box
- `Replace` will apply the specified changes to the image
- `View Loaded Image Colors` and `View Edited Image Colors` will show a popup of all the unique colors and their RGBA values of the loaded and edited image respectively, this should help with finding the exact color to replace ;)

#### Example
The background of this image is transparent

<img src="info/color_replace_sample.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

It can be easily set to any color one likes (i.e. black)

Looking at the table of all the colors in the picture

<img src="info/table.PNG" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

One must replace `(230,230,230,255)` and `(255,255,255,255)` with `(0,0,0,255)`, which produces

<img src="info/color_replace_sample_result.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

This tool is very nice to change background colors and transparencies!

### Note
#### Can't Find Your Image?
<img src="info/selectfile.PNG" alt="drawing" width="150"/>

Use the dropdown to change the type of file being searched when selecting an image to be opened

#### Which File Is Edited?

If there is an existing `Edited File` (you can check by clicking on `View Edited`), the modifications are on that image, else the modifications are performed on the `Loaded File` and the changes are stored as the `Edited File`
